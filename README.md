## Description

This game is based on the original toy of the same name. 
The computer will give you a signal to start with to play this game, and you must repeat the signal by clicking on the same colour tile. 
Every successful repetition of the sequence during each level will add a new tile to the sequence. 
Failing to repeat the sequence will result in the computer flashing red and playing a loud buzzer sound.
This game was a project in a Web Developer Bootcamp from the App Brewery.
